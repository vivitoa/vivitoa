# MyDevEvolution
Sharing my bio and coding journey as I dive deeper into Python and development.


👩‍💻 I’m an aspiring programmer, currently building my skills in Python, AI 🤖, and Linux administration 🐧. I’m actively working on projects related to my educational course, which I share here on GitHub as part of my journey to becoming a well-rounded developer.

💡 Coding is my passion. I’m fascinated by how programming can solve real-world problems, streamline processes, and drive innovation. Whether it’s automating repetitive tasks, developing intelligent systems, or managing complex Linux environments, I enjoy creating impactful solutions.

🚀 I’m focused on deepening my expertise in AI, particularly in machine learning and data science, and Linux administration, where I aim to build strong infrastructure and systems management skills.

🔍 My goal is to continually grow as a developer, contribute to meaningful projects, and leverage my programming skills to make a tangible difference. I’m eager to bring my passion for coding and my problem-solving mindset to a professional environment where I can collaborate, learn from experienced colleagues, and contribute to impactful projects.
